# NIRVAI SCRIPTS

- useful scripts
- readme & info for scripts coming soon

## TLDR

- many of the scripts rely on shell fns [within this public repo](https://github.com/noahehall/theBookOfNoah/tree/master/linux/bash_cli_fns)
- you can setup your shell to be l33t like me by [sourcing this file](https://github.com/noahehall/theBookOfNoah/blob/master/linux/_sourceme_.sh) in the parent directory
